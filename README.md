# thin_to_thick
Converts a thin jail to a thick jail

A thin jail often uses a nullfs mount to supply the main jail directories.

This process based on https://github.com/iocage/iocage/issues/730

ezjail uses this approach. This is a typical ezjail basejail:

```
$ ls -l /usr/jails/newjail
total 203
-r--r--r--   1 root  wheel  6197 Apr  4  2015 COPYRIGHT

This tool is designed to allow you to copy an existing thin jail into a thick jail,
ignoring the bits provided by the basejail.

# Usage:

```
thin_to_thick /usr/jails/newjail /usr/jails/snapshots /iocage/jails/snapshots3/root
```

where:

```
/usr/jails/newjail            = example base jail
/usr/jails/snapshots          = the jail you want to convert
/iocage/jails/snapshots3/root = the destination of the new thick jail
                                must already be created
```

NOTE: neither the src jail nor the dest jail may be running

# Steps for converting a thin jail to a thick jail

In this example, we will assume:

* The thin jail was created by [ezjail](http://erdgeist.org/arts/software/ezjail/)
* The thick jail will be created using [iocage](https://github.com/iocage/iocage)
* The thin jail is located at /usr/jails/snapshots
* The thick jail will be located at /iocage/jails/snapshots

## stop the thin jail

```
ezjail-admin stop snapshots
```

## create the thick jail

```
iocage create --thickjail -r 11.2-RELEASE -n snapshots
```

The newly created thick jail must be the same release version as the old thin jail.

The author was concerned only getting the release name correct and was not concerned by patch levels (e.g. `FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE-p7`).

## optionally snapshot the new jail

```
zfs snapshot -r system/iocage/jails/snapshots@clean
```

The actual filesystem name will most certainly not match the above. `zfs list` will show you the information you need.

## Populate the iocage config.json file

iocage uses a configuration file using JSON format.  This file is located in the main directory. In our example, that is

```
$ cat /iocage/jails/snapshots/config.json 
{
    "host_hostname": "snapshots",
    "host_hostuuid": "snapshots",
    "jail_zfs_dataset": "iocage/jails/snapshots/data",
    "release": "11.2-RELEASE"
}
```

The above represents the values immediately after the `iocage create` command.

There are two important parts to set in this file:

* release information
* IP address

### release information

The release info can be found in the old basejail files via the freebsd-update executable:

```
$ grep USERLAND_VERSION= /usr/jails/basejail/bin/freebsd-version
USERLAND_VERSION="11.2-RELEASE-p7"
```

In this case, the release information is already correct.  This edit must be done manually. After update, the new values are.

```
{
    "host_hostname": "snapshots",
    "host_hostuuid": "snapshots",
    "jail_zfs_dataset": "iocage/jails/snapshots/data",
    "release": "11.2-RELEASE-p7"
}
```

### IP address

The IP addresses for our ezjail jail are in /usr/local/etc/ezjail/snapshots

```
$ grep ip= /usr/local/etc/ezjail/snapshots
export jail_snapshots_ip="10.55.0.70"
```

The new value can be configured via:

```
$ sudo iocage set ip4_addr="10.55.0.70" snapshots
Property: ip4_addr has been updated to 10.55.0.70
```

The change can be confirmed via this command:

```
$ grep ip4_addr /iocage/jails/snapshots/config.json 
    "ip4_addr": "10.55.0.70",
```

### Other jail settings

There are many other jail settings you may need to configure.  Here are a couple:

* /etc/fstab.snapshots
* /usr/local/etc/ezjail/snapshots

#### /etc/fstab.snapshots

If ezjil was mounting more than the basejail for your old jail, these can be easily copied into iocage as well.

Given our example, you want to look in /etc/fstab.snapshots on the jail host.

```
$ cat /etc/fstab.snapshots
/usr/jails/basejail /usr/jails/snapshots/basejail nullfs ro 0 0
```

The basejail line isnâ€™t needed in for our situation, because we are using thick jails. If there are other entries, you will
need to copy them to `/iocage/jails/snapshots/fstab`. Be sure to adjust the pathname accordingly, base on where your iocage jails are located.

### /usr/local/etc/ezjail/snapshots

ezjail stores most configuration items in /usr/local/etc/ezjail/JAILNAME and in our example, /usr/local/etc/ezjail/snapshots will contain settings we might want to copy over.

In the author's example, he found this:

```
export jail_snapshots_parameters="enforce_statfs=0 allow.mount=1 allow.mount.zfs=1"
```

This will need to be set in iocage, usually via `iocate set` but the details are outside the scope for this task.

## run the script

```
thin_to_thick /usr/jails/newjail /usr/jails/snapshots /iocage/jails/snapshots/root
```

## start the jail

```
iocage start standard
```



# Post conversion

You will probably want to the set the old ezjail jail to not run on boot:

```
ezjail-admin config -r norun snapshots
```

Similarly, when ready, set the iocage jail to start on boot:

```
iocage set boot=on snapshots
```
